    "# INTRODUCTION TO SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machine learning is a subset of supervised learning algorithm used for classification primarily. It offers high accuracy compared to other algorithms like logistica regression. SVM is used in a variaty of applications such as intrusion detection, email classification, handwritin recognition, face detection and web pages classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is primarily used for classification problems but can aslo be used for regression problems. It can eaily handle continuous and categorical data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **hyper plane**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Thi is a decision plane which separate a set of objects having different classes. Its basically a boundary that seperates data points, dividing them into classes. Its the half of the value of the margin. **The hyperplane is also called the decision boundary**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - in one dimension, a hyperplane is called a point\n",
    "    - in two dimensions, it is a line\n",
    "    + in three dimensions, it is a plane\n",
    "    * in more dimensions you can call it an hyperplane\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Support vector**\n",
    "\n",
    "    These are the data points closest to the hyperplane\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Margin or distance margin**\n",
    "\n",
    "     This is the distance between the two lines on the support vectors, its the perpendicular line between the support vectors of each class. The bigger the margin the better,we always want to find the highest margin distance.\n",

    "## How an SVM works\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier the SVM is used for classification, its main aim is to divide the data set into groups(segregate the data). SVM searchs for the maximum marginal hyperplane, let me give you a quick summary of how the SVM  works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the hyperplane with the maximum margin\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. incase a nonlinear hyperplane can't be applied due to the datasets being too mixed up, where one class data points are found in the data points of another class. In such cases we use the kernel functions, a kernel function basically takes a low dimension input and outputs a higher dimension dataset. Example it takes a 2-D and outputs a 3-D. This increase in dimention makes it easy to segregate or divide the different classes. This technique is called `kernel trick`. In simply terms the SVM kernel converts nonseparable problem into a separable one by adding more dimensions to it so a plane can be drawn for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a support vector machine is to find  the optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-linear Data set\n",
    "\n",
    "consider the image below, its clear that a linear hyperplane can't be applied on the current dimensions(2-D). To solve this we need to introduce another dimension to get a 3-D maybe the data set will be separable in this dimension(3-D). Hence we are able to draw a hyperplane(plane) in a 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping from 2D to 3D\n",
    "\n",
    "but we can't just blindly add a new dimension, to add a new dimension it must be well and intentionaly calculated. This can be done by \n",
    "\n",
    "## $$ z = x^2 + y^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note the $ z $ value will always be positive since its the squared of a given number $ x $ and $ y $**\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formula is used to map from 2D to 3D, from the formula we can make an inference, the lowe the $ x $ and $ y $ values the lower the poit in the new dimension we have added and so on. Hence the new image of the lemons and apples will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can easily separate the two classes. These transformations are called kernels. Popular kernels are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Polynomial Kernel\n",
    "2. Gaussian Kernel\n",
    "3. Radial Basis Function (RBF)\n",
    "4. Laplace RBF Kernel\n",
    "5. Sigmoid Kernel\n",
    "6. Anove RBF Kernel\n",

    "### Mapping from 1D to 2D\n",
    "\n",

    "![](images/image5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This kernel is used to compute higher dimension relationship between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel takes data in a lower dimension and outputs data into a higher dimension, this is not the actaul case since, the data points are just treated as if they are in a highet dimension but the data set is not actually transformed, this is what is known as the **kernel trick**. This is done to avoid the expensive computation to actually tranform the data set into a higher dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Parameter Tunning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right kernel to use is very crucial a bad decision will lead to  a poorly performing model. Always check if your data is linear then use a **linear kernel**(linear SVM). Linear SVM is a parametric model, but an RBF kernel SVM isn’t, so the complexity grows with the size of the training set. The RBF kernel SVM are more expensive and you have to also store the kernel matrix in memory, as the dimensions increase, it becomes computationaly expensive and overfitting the model is an easy occurance. The RBF is suitable in cases when $ n^{th} $ dimensions are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.  Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter tells the SVM algorithm how much miss classification you want to avoid. This parameter is represented by the capital letter **C**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher **C** the model will use a smaller hyperplane margin, so the model can increase avoidance of miss classification of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowe the **C** the model will use a maximum margin hyperplane, so as to increase the tolerance of miss classification of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short the **reguralization value is directly proportional to the margin size**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the best regularization value is key to avoid overfitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.  Gamma\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma is another important parameter, it determines how far away and how many support vectors are used to calculate the hyperplane. Higher gamma means the model will use support vectors that are closest to the plausible hyperplane while low gamma means support vectors at great distances will be used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/image7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, gamma is inversely proportional to the number and distance of the support vectors used to determine the plausible hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin is another important parameter to take into account, when using SVM the margin we want is the one with the highest value(maximum margin hyperplane). The higher the margin the better the model or classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, maximizing the distances between nearest data point and hyper-plane will help us to decide the right hyper-plane to use."

    "## Disadvantage of SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Its not suitable for large amounts of data since, it takes a lot of time to train, its not suitable for ovelapping classes.\n",
